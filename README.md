>Anne Pro 2 RGB control through Node.js

## About This Project

This Node.js module allows controlling the Anne Pro 2 RGB keyboard keys without ObinsKit. Anne Pro 1 compatibility has not been tested as I don't have that keyboard.

Currently, settings are not saved and custom LED graphics set with this module are lost when the keyboard loses power or when user changes the profile with a keyboard button. This works similarly to the profile preview mode in ObinsKit.

## Prerequisites

* Node v12.x LTS or newer
* npm 6.x or newer
* Anne Pro 2 keyboard connected over USB

## Installation

Windows, Linux, OSX:

```sh
npm install -g annemone
```

>CLI currently only supports setting the entire keyboard to one color.

As an Node package:

1. Install as an npm package
2. `var Annemone = require('annemone')`
3. `const LEDController = new Annemone.LEDController();`

## Usage example

### CLI

Set keyboard to red:
`annemone single 255 0 255`

### annemone module

#### Annemone.LEDController.setMultiColorLed(ledMatrix)

Set per-key RBG value.

Accepts a two-dimensional matrix with RGB values corresponding to each of the 61 keys as they appear on the keyboard.

There's a delay between commands as the keyboard doesn't understand commands that are sent faster than 50ms apart. This is also compounded by the fact that HID doesn't have high data throughput rate. Consider using the `setSingleColorLed` method if your application don't need to set per-key color.

Example matrix:

```js
[
    [255, 0, 0] // esc
    [255, 0, 0] // 1
    [255, 0, 0] // 2
    ...
],
[
    [255, 0, 0] // tab
    [255, 0, 0] // q
    [255, 0, 0] // w
    ...
]
...
```

#### Annemone.LEDController.setIndividualKeys(matrixState)

Alternative way to set individual key colors. Takes an object with each key and its corresponding color like this: { f: [255,0,0], esc: [0,255,255]}

Note that this function is not aware of the current keyboard state and will turn off all LEDs not specified in the input object.

#### Annemone.LEDController.setSingleColorLed(rgb)

Set all keys to one color.

Takes an array with 3 elements: red, green and blue.

Example RGB: `[255, 0, 0]`

#### Annemone.LEDController.generateMultiColor(arrayOfRgbValues, mcu_address = 65, command_info = [32, 3, 255, 2])

HID packet generator for `setMultiColorLed`.

* arrayOfRgbValues: 70 sequential rgb values for each key (skip the following keys as they do not exist on the board: *41, 43, 55, 57, 60, 61, 63, 64*)
* mcu_address: not sure what an MCU is internally, possibly depends on whether this is an Anne Pro or Anne Pro 2, code suggests this can only be 65 or 49
* command_info:
  * 32: appears to select the destination (32 is LED)
  * 3: LED command type selector
  * 255: unknown, doesn't do anything
  * 2: selects a preset lighting profile (2 is static rainbow for example)

#### Annemone.LEDController.generateOneColor(rbg_color, mcu_address = 65)

HID packet generator for `setSingleColorLed`.

#### Annemone.LEDController.write(message)

HID write wrapper with a forced delay.

Needed due to Anne Pro 2 ignoring commands when they're sent faster than 50ms apart from each other.

## Development setup

To install a local version for development purposes, use the following set of commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/illixion/Annemone.git
cd Annemone
npm i
```

Now that you have a local version of Annemone, you can use these commands in Node to import it locally:

```js
var Annemone = require("./index.js");
const LEDController = new Annemone.LEDController();
```
